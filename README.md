# Speedy Components

## Under heavy development

Only some of the components demoed here are actually integrated into the LBG speedy codebase.

### An AngularJs library for the speedy project to extend apon the CapitalOne Hygieia Project.

This is a collection of components, modules, services and directives that extend the functionality of the Hygieia project.  The library utilises ES6 features and is transpiled using webpack. 

It also includes an exmple app to showcase some of the components.

The library includes upstream work done by a separate Sapient team as a dependency.
